# Verilog_MUX_DEMUX using Verilog HDL

This repository contains Verilog HDL implementations of commonly used **Multiplexers (MUX)** and a **Demultiplexer (DEMUX)**. These are fundamental combinational logic circuits widely used in digital systems for data selection and data routing applications.

Each module is implemented in Verilog HDL and verified using a dedicated testbench.

---

## 📌 Description

A **Multiplexer (MUX)** is a combinational circuit that selects one input from multiple input lines and forwards it to a single output based on the value of the select lines. It is commonly referred to as a **data selector**.

A **Demultiplexer (DEMUX)** performs the opposite operation. It takes a single input and routes it to one of several output lines depending on the select inputs. Therefore, it is also known as a **data distributor**.

This repository includes the following implementations:

- 2×1 Multiplexer
- 4×1 Multiplexer
- 8×1 Multiplexer
- 1×4 Demultiplexer

# Multiplexer (MUX)

## Description

A Multiplexer selects one of several input signals and transmits the selected input to a single output. The number of select lines required is determined by:

```
Number of Select Lines = log₂(Number of Inputs)
```

---

## 2×1 Multiplexer

### Inputs

- I0
- I1
- S (Select)

### Output

- Y

### Boolean Expression

```
Y = S'·I0 + S·I1
```

### Truth Table

| S | Output |
|:-:|:------:|
| 0 | I0 |
| 1 | I1 |
